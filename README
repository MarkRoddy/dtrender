dtrender is a command line tool for running django templates.  This
proves useful for generating text (not just web pages) with individual
aspects that change frequently enough that seperating it from the 
markup but not frequently enough to warrant complete dynamic delivery
of the text (such as full django site).  

For example, a text document which contains some source code could
be written as a template and the source code kept in a seperate file
so that it may be executed and the full document rebuilt.
